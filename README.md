This repo contains two codebases: [web](https://github.com/Dragon1207/challenge/tree/master/web) contains a React app that is powered by a REST API in the   [api](https://github.com/Dragon1207/challenge/tree/master/api) directory. The API uses [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) to talk to a SQLite database.

## Setup
1. Install Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install yarn: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable
3. Install deps by running `yarn deps`
4. Start the app with `yarn start`

###

If all went well, you should be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
